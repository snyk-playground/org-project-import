# Required: this file will likely change in the future, so we're versioning it from the beginning
schema: 1
# Optional: the API using the UUID for org and integration, but we want to reference them by name
# when import.yaml is parsed it will perform the lookup against the approved org names and integration types
# that exist in the config repo. This ensures that a repo can't be moved to a org outside of the control of 
# the team that deploys snyk and that if an intergration is redone (and uuid changes) we don't need to update
# every repository
orgName: cse-ownership
# Name of the integration to use - will default to same named integration used in config repo
# this allows for a future option of pulling in projects in repos not in github but managing that list in github
# github, github-enterprise, bitbucket, azure-repos
integrationName: github-enterprise
# Optional: any tags present here will be applied to *all* projects created by this import action
# we don't support attributes at this time
# tags:
#   application: example
#   team: cse
# Optional: folder/filenames to exclude (not paths)
# exclusionGlobs: "fixtures, tests, __tests__, node_modules"
# Optional: provide one or more branches for import
